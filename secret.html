        <p class="message">
            The day we met in the mall is a moment forever etched in my heart. Seeing you for the first time,
            I was so overwhelmed with emotions, I nearly passed out. Your presence struck me like a beautiful melody,
            enchanting and mesmerizing. Since that day, not a second goes by without you on my mind.
            You are my constant thought, my incessant joy, and my eternal love. Happy Valentine's Day, my love.
